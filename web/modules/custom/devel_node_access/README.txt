README.txt for Devel Node Access 8.x-1.x



>>>> Please feel free to suggest improvements and additions to this file! <<<<




Overview
--------

DNA contains tools for developers using access control modules
to restrict access to some nodes.  It is intended to help catch some
common mistakes and provide feedback to confirm that restricted nodes
are in fact visible only to the intended users.

Provides a block which shows all node_access entries for the nodes
shown on a given page.  This gives developers a quick check to see
that grants are provided as they should be.  This block auto-enables
to the footer region. You may move it as desired.




Requirements
------------

DNA will not do anything if you have no node access module installed.




Prior Versions
--------------

DNA has been part of the Devel module up to Drupal 7.
It's in its own project until the port to D8 is completed (#2215439).
Keeping it in a subdirectory should allow merging it back into Devel.
